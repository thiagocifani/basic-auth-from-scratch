The test ask to create a basic login form to check if the email and password are present and valid. I could use devise to do all the job for me, but basically, this test
is for demonstrate how I basically program. I chose to implement it the easiest way possible, from the scratch to accomplish this task.

To run this app you should use the following commands:
   - bundle
   - rake db:setup


To run the test suite:
   - rspec spec
